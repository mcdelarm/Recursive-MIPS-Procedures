# MIPS Recursive Procedures Project

In this project, I implement three recursive MIPS procedures.

First, I implement `bingen` in bingen.asm, which prints the binary patterns of length `N` (e.g., for `N = 3`, `000`, `001`, ... , `111`). Then, I implement a binary search tree's (BST) recursive `insert` and `inorder` functions in bst.asm.
